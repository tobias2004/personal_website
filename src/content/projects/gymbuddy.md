## How I Built It

- **Backend**: I built a microservice-based backend using **FastAPI**. It includes endpoints for searching exercises, logging workouts, and retrieving historical data‚Äîeach backed by an **SQLite** database.
- **Frontend**: I designed a polished **PyQt5** interface, allowing users to log workouts and visualize progress through embedded **Matplotlib** graphs.
- **Architecture**: The system uses a modular microservices structure, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Development Methodology**: The codebase was developed using the **Agile Scrum** framework for efficient task breakdown and iteration.
