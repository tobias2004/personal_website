      Hi, Iâ€™m Tobias Kohn, a computer science student, data science researcher, and machine learning enthusiast studying at Oregon State University.\n

      I am passionate about developing robust, user and developer-friendly appications by integrating technical expertise with my soft-skills of leadership, public speaking, and relationship-building.\n

      Currently, I'm working to enhance my shell personal project by combining my background in machine learning with my interest in computational mathematics. I'm developing a custom Linear Algebra library in C.\n

      When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking the outdoors, trying out new cooking recepies, and spending quality time with my friends and family.
